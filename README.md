We are using KVQA dataset (http://malllabiisc.github.io/resources/kvqa/). It is a VQA dataset, but we are not using images as part of input. In place of images, we are using list of already identified named entities from the image. This list is available as part of the dataset. 

It is a world-knowledge aware VQA task, and to make it aware we are using knowledge facts which are part of the dataset.

Implementation is in python and pytorch.
